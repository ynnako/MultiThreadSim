  The memory image filename is composed from segments of 2 types, defined by an "@" location/type line:
  1. "I@<address>" : The following lines are instructions at given memory offset.
     Each subsequent line up to the next "@" line is an instruction of format: <command> <dst>,<src1>,<src2>
     Commands is one of: NOP, ADD, SUB, LOAD, STORE
     operands are $<num> for any general purpose register, or just a number for immediate (for src2 only)
  2. "D@<address>" : The following lines are data values at given memory offset.
     Each subsequent line up the the next "@"is data value of a 32 bit (hex.) data word, e.g., 0x12A556FF
  \returns 0 - for success in reseting and loading image file. <0 in case of error.
